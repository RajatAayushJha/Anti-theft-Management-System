AIM : To Make an ANTI-THEFT SYSTEM WITH THE FOLLOWING FEATURES :
                 1.Self locking door 
                 2. Using Internet of things :
                      2.1 remote unlock
                      2.2 gesture recognition
                 3. Automatic unlock based on proximity

Automatic Lock : The doors are fit with self-closing hinge. Whenever the door closes, the servo motor gets triggered and door is latched.
Gesture Recognition : Using OpenCV
Remote Unlock : We use IoT to connect the system to Wifi and further to room ownerâ€™s phone. Using this, he/she can remotely unlock the                    door.
Automatic Unlock : Based on Bluetooth/RF.

Requirements : 
             MSP430 by Texas Instruments - The MSP430 is a mixed-signal microcontroller family from Texas Instruments. Built around a 16-bit CPU, the MSP430 is designed for low cost and, specifically, low power consumption embedded applications
